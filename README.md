Summary: 

To implement the task I used vanilla JavaScript, without any libraries or frameworks. 
First of all I started with a basic HTML structure of the project. Of course I had to rework it a couple of times.
Then I added a products.js file to store all of my items in it. After that I created the function for creating the product tiles based on the array of objects stored in my
products.js file, and a basic initializtion function to run the app.
I started adding some CSS styles just to have an idea of how the app should look and if the implemented things were working.
After that I created a function to render the products on the screen. But when the sorting and filtering functionalities were needed I reworked my rendering function
to work based on the sorting, category, and filter selected as I keep track of them in a variables.
Then I added the sorting function, the categories function and the filtering, which I combined in the rendering as i said before.
I also added a handler for the load more button.
A modal when clicking on the add to cart button, which is able to be closed by clicking on the okay button in it or anywhere on the page.
At the end I worked on the styling of the app, tried different things about how the app should look both on web and mobile devices.
